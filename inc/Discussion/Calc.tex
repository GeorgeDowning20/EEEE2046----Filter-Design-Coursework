% Once you are happy with the operation of your circuit, you will consider practical implications of
% building the circuit. Create a new copy of your design that uses resistor and capacitor values that
% are readily available. Resistor and capacitor values are typically available in so-called “E” ranges.
% There is a link in the references section that provides more details. You are permitted to use
% component values from the E24 range only, and should only use a single
% resistor/capacitor in each place. This means that for the capacitor with value 141.2 pF already
% used as an example, there would be a choice between a 130 pF and 150 pF capacitor. Using a
% combination of 130 pF + 10 pF would not be accepted.
