% You should include in your report a complete set of the calculations for your design, with appropriate
% explanations. Any circuit submission without an accompanying set of working out will not be
% marked.
% Once you have your complete set of calculations and component values, you should implement
% your design in LT Spice, using exact rather than rounded component values – e.g. use 141.2pF if
% that is what your calculation suggested, rather than rounding to 140pF. For the op-amp, use the
% LT1498. To simplify your design, please make use of a dual rail power supply, i.e. ±5V, and
% centre all of your signals on ground.
