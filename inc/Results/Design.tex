% Design and simulate a high pass Butterworth filter using the Sallen Key topology:

% Gain: 1
% Pass band: 100+(use your student ID, last 2 digits)Hz
% Stop band: 50Hz
% Stop band attenuation: 30dB
% Further details of how to go about the technical aspects of this task are included later in this
% document â€“ this section just aims to describe what you need to do.

% Break: 162hz
% order: 4 (stop band 50hz @ 50 hz)
