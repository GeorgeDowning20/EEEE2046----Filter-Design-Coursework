% To verify your design, carry out two simulations:
% 1. An AC simulation to determine the amplitude response of your circuit.
% Use an AC 1 V input and plot the output of your complete design. Check the -3 dB low cut
% off frequency of your filter from the plot (ensure you have used enough points in the AC
% sweep to obtain a smooth response). If it does not match, check your design and
% EEEE2046 – Practical Engineering Design Solutions and Project Development
% Electronics Project – Filter Design Coursework
% calculations. Include a figure containing the plot of the amplitude response in your report,
% and also include the -3dB low cut off frequency achieved.
% 2. A transient response simulation.
% You should configure your input voltage source to be 1 V amplitude with an appropriate
% frequency. Check the operation of your circuit well into the pass band, e.g. at 500 Hz. Please
% choose an appropriate simulation length so that around 10 cycles of the input can be seen.
% Include a copy of the plot in your report then describe what you expect the output to be and
% whether the circuit output matches this. Repeat the transient simulation with an input at
% 10Hz. You should determine what you expect the output voltage to be at this frequency,
% include your output plot and state whether it meets your expected value.
% What is the high cut off frequency of your circuit? What causes this limit? Provide an answer to
% these questions in your report.

% Most simulation results clearly highlight the performance of the circuits and are well presented.
% The output of the simulations are discussed and compared, in detail, to the expected behavior.
