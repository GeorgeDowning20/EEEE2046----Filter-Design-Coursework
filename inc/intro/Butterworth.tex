% Carry out research into different filter characteristics and their applications. In your report, provide
% a description of the advantages and disadvantages of each of Butterworth, Chebyshev and Bessel
% filter designs and include examples of where these filters can be found in real life products. You can
% then expand and explain on why, for that particular application, it is beneficial to have such a filter.
% It's recommended to use IEEE publications, IET, books and scientific websites. Wikipedia can't be
% used in your reference list
